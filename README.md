# data_dragon (数据一条龙)

The widget code was collected from my data engineering work. 
These are code clips during my daily work to solve the hand on problem.
The code is somewhat casual written and using different languages, such as bash shell, Python, Java, C, etc.

The repository name is came up with the Chinese name 「数据一条龙」, which means it can handle the data engineering work from end to end.

Hope some of these code can save your time, as it already did for me.
